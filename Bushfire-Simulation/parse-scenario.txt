The function parse_scenario(filename) that parses a file with the structure described below, validates the contents and returns either a dictionary containing all values required to specify a model scenario if the contents are valid, or None if any of the contents are invalid.

The structure of the file is as follows:

    an integer specifying the width and height (M) of the square landscape grid
    M lines, each containing M integer values (separated by commas), defining the initial fuel load of the landscape (a visual representation of the M by M grid)
    M lines, each containing M integer values (separated by commas), defining the height of the landscape (again, a visual representation of the M by M grid)
    an integer specifying the ignition threshold for this scenario
    a one or two character string specifying the wind direction for this scenario (or 'None' if there is no wind)
    one or more lines, each containing the (i,j) coordinates (row number, column number) of a cell which is burning at the start of the simulation

For example, the file 'bf0.dat':

bf0.dat
2
2,2
0,2
1,2
1,2
1
N
0,0


specifies a 2 by 2 landscape:

    there is an initial fuel load of 2 in three of the four cells, with a fuel load of 0 in the cell c1,0
    the height of all cells in the first column (j=0) is 1, while the height of all cells in the second column (j=1) is 2 (ie, the landscape slopes up toward the East)
    the ignition threshold is 1
    a wind is blowing from the North
    the top left cell c0,0 is burning at the start of the simulation

You may assume that the input files are well-formed, but your function should ensure that:

    the dimensions of the grid are a positive integer;
    the ignition threshold is a positive integer not greater than eight;
    the wind direction is valid; and
    the coordinates of the burning cells are (a) located on the landscape, and (b) have non-zero initial fuel load.

If all values are valid, your function should return a dictionary with key/value pairs as follows:

    f_grid: a list of lists (of dimensions M by M)
    h_grid: a list of lists (of dimensions M by M)
    i_threshold: an integer
    w_direction: a string or None
    burn_seeds: a list of tuples

If there is no wind, w_direction can be either an empty string '' or None.

If any values are invalid, your function should return None.

For example:
>>> parse_scenario('bf0.dat')
{'f_grid': [[2, 2], [0, 2]],
 'h_grid': [[1, 2], [1, 2]],
 'i_threshold': 1,
 'w_direction': 'N',
 'burn_seeds': [(0, 0)]}
>>> parse_scenario('bf.dat')
{'f_grid': [[1, 2, 1], [0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 1]],
 'h_grid': [[1, 1, 1], [2, 1, 2], [3, 2, 2]],
 'i_threshold': 1,
 'w_direction': 'N',
 'burn_seeds': [(1, 1)]}
